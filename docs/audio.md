### How to use the OptoActive II:

1. Turn on the console by flipping the switch in the back:
2. The OptoActive computer box (shown below) automatically turns on when the console is switched on. Make sure the blue LED light on the front of this box is lit (as shown in the image below). If it isn't, check the power button on the top right of the front panel. If that button is depressed (i.e., pushed in), push the button to release it to be flush with the surface of the panel. The LED light should turn on and the system will then be ready.
